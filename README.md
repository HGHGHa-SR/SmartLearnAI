An AI-powered framework for optimizing personalized learning in scientific domains using deep reinforcement learning, cognitive modeling, and knowledge graph-based recommendation systems.

## Overview

Personalized learning is transforming modern education by tailoring instructional content to individual learner needs. However, most current systems lack real-time adaptability and cognitive awareness, especially in complex, knowledge-intensive fields such as dust and polluted aerosol research.

This project introduces **ALIN (Adaptive Learning Intelligence Network)**, a novel deep learning-based framework that dynamically personalizes educational content using cognitive modeling, reinforcement learning, and knowledge graphs. By formulating learning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), ALIN continuously adapts to each learner's engagement level and knowledge proficiency.

We further implement **PALS (Personalized Adaptive Learning Strategy)** to enhance the responsiveness and effectiveness of content delivery. PALS integrates Bayesian knowledge tracing and real-time pedagogical adaptation to support intelligent decision-making for personalized learning paths.
